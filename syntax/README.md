# Syntax Highlighting

`ledger.sublime-syntax` can be placed in Sublime Text's `User` dir, e.g.

    ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User

This will apply syntax highlighting to files with extensions `ldg` and
`ledger`. From the included example file for the Monokai color scheme:

![syntax highlighting example](../docs/images/ledger-syntax-highlighting-3.png)

`syntax_test_ledger.ldg` can be placed in the `User` dir as well and the
`build` command will run the included tests. (My User dir is symlinked
to Drobox and I got errors running the tests, so I moved it up a level
to Packages.)

`.sublime-syntax` is a newer syntax definition format. Still included
here are the older tmLanguage files. (Although no longer maintained.)
The `ledger.JSON-tmLanguage` file is used to generate the XML
`.tmLanguage` file, which likewise would be placed in the `User` dir.

Syntax tests can be used on both newer and older syntax formats, but
this test file only works with the `.sublime-syntax` file because I
changed a lot of the regular expressions and scope names.
